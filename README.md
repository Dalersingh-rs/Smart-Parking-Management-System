# Smart-Parking-Management-System
In this project, a model is developed using MATLAB and Arduino Uno to simulate the entire process of a parking space, with cars entering and exiting on time. The prototype has a great deal of potential to grow into a packed parking management system, and it can be implemented in any suitable location in the future with very few minor changes.
